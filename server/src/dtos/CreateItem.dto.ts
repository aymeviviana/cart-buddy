/**
 * ðŸŽ¯ FEEDBACK: File Organization
 *
 * This file is no longer needed because we've moved the Item interface to the models file.
 * This follows the principle of keeping related types together.
 *
 * The Item interface is now defined in server/src/models/List.ts where it belongs
 * since it's part of the List model structure.
 *
 * This file can be deleted.

// Item interface has been moved to server/src/models/List.ts
// Please import it from there instead: import { Item } from "../models/List.js";
